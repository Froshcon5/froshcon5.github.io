**INTRO**
##

  Like said in the description, my current plan is to tinker with streaming in multiple aspects like looking at the software, marketing, and security problems involved. As of 2020 esports gaming is projected to become a 3.5 billion dollar industry by 2025. So by examining this industry I'll be able to learn more about things like different cloud operations, programming, as well as network and security operations. I'll probably cover other things as well like classes and what we've learned as well.

**STREAMING**
##

	My current plan is to create the stream, see what broadcasting software is available for streamers as well as their benefits and drawbacks of each. Then I'll move into marketing and viewer platforms eventually leading to different methods on optimizing the stream and maximizing viewer numbers. I'm pretty sure I'll find and learn alot of things I hadnt even considered when it comes to something like streaming and it's going to be great to cover that here and hopefully help or teach someone! I haven't created a blog before, so this alone is going to be a neat experience.

  As for the first step, streamlabs OBS (Open Broadcaster software) appears to be the the most popular streaming service today and twitch the pretty obvious option to begin things. I created my OBS account along with my twitch account and connected the two which it prompts you to do. I didn't expect that I had to attach a paypal account but it was recommended so I attached that as well. Streaming itsself was pretty easy and any questions I had for things like stream layouts and such were easily searched on google. I streamed a couple hours of Apex Legends and everything operated smoothly. I did realize that all of the software I had used so far was free to use but with premium paid options. Maybe that should be a theme? However if I only do the free options I likely wont be able to maximize my viewership down the road. I'll have to do my research and let you all know what I come up with! By the end I even had 4 people viewing which was promising. I did see that some bots will automatically join your chat or feed sometimes once you begin your stream but these users all trickled in at various times, so for now I don't have reason to believe thats the case. Overall it was pretty enjoyable. I think this week I'm going to look into different broadcasting services and viewer platforms to see how and where the different ways views are reached by these streamers. 
  
  Well if you made it this far, then thanks! I hope you enjoy this blog and my crazy adventures in it. I'm going to try and update it every Sunday and Friday as life permits. So long until next Friday and have a great week!
