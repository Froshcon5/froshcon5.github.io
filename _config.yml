# Short bio or description (displayed in the header)
description: Good day! My name is JJ and I'm currently a student studying networking and cybersecurity. This will mostly cover my adventures in getting into streaming as well as other hobbies as I get into them. For now I picked streaming because as the gaming industry continues to grow and streaming continues to rise there are always going to be software, marketing, and security problems that always arise. Gaming encompasses a large spectrum of the skills utilized in the IT industry and my adventures in streaming will help to bring me to identify and assess the problems and their solutions!
